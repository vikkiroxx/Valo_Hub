      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Classic is the pistol that all players receive upon spawning.

Compared to most other weapons, the Classic does a meager amount of damage. However, its nonexistent price tag makes it effective for rounds in which the player or team wishes to save credits for later rounds.

Due to its low damage output, the Classic requires more shots than most in order to score a kill. Typically, a player with the Classic must hit two or three shots to the head, 7 to the body, or 8 to the legs.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Shorty is the cheapest purchasable weapon in the game. It costs 200 credits and is a semi-automatic, sawed-off double-barreled shotgun.

This weapon is particularly useful for players who want to save credits. It excels in short-range combat and ambush maneuvers, especially in tight corridors and chokepoints. Due to the Shorty's small clip size, it excels at quick, one-on-one exchanges, but struggles in more sustained firefights against multiple enemies due to the frequent need to reload.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Frenzy is a fully automatic, low-cost pistol. It does relatively high damage, typically requiring 7-8 shots to the body and 3 to the head to kill. It's most effective at close range with sustained fire, but can experience limited usefulness at long ranges in short bursts.

It is a great choice for players who wish to save Credits due to its low price tag, but its high damage at close range keeps it viable even against more expensive weapons.

Due to its quick rate of fire and small magazine size, a player wielding the Frenzy will have to reload often and should be aware of that fact.</p>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Sheriff is the most expensive sidearm in the game, costing 800 Credits. It is a semi-automatic revolver with a six-shot magazine and high damage output.

The sidearm is extremely useful for economy and pistol rounds, due to its relatively cheap price and high damage output, rivalling that of most rifles. It typically takes 4 shots to the legs, 3 to the body, and 1 to the head to kill.

The main disadvantage of the Sheriff is in its long pullout time and severe recoil. It has the most recoil of any pistol and takes quite a bit of time to recover.</p>

It deals a fairly high amount of damage upon hit, usually taking 2 shots to the head and 5 to 6 shots to the body to kill. The Ghost comes equipped with a silencer, which helps to increase its overall accuracy, and also reduces noise while firing, making it effective as a stealth weapon.

The Ghost is a reliable backup weapon. Its above-average accuracy, good damage and overall consistency allows you to rely on the pistol during most situations.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Stinger sits at 1100 credits and is unique for its high fire rate and short range.

It has an alternate fire mode when aiming down sights, consisting of a four round burst with tighter spread and less recoil. This can be effective at close range to instantly head-burst someone, or at medium range to rapidly finish off a wounded target, however sustained DPS is very low in this fire mode and accuracy is still poor.

The Stinger has a low damage per shot compared to nearly every other weapon in the game, and furthermore has an absurdly high spread, leading to lower accuracy. However, the stinger is very cheap, and has high damage per second. Its time-to-kill is good against players with 100 and 125HP, but becomes much less effective against players with 150HP (due to requiring 3 head-shots or 6 body-shots).</p>

It is outfitted with a silencer that reduces the range of the weapon's audio profile. In comparison to the Stinger, it is substantially more accurate, kicks considerably less, possesses slightly more cover piercing capability, and has a higher magazine capacity (30 as opposed to 20). However, its slightly lower per-shot damage and lessened fire rate render its total output statistically lower.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Bulldog is a fully-automatic rifle, and is the cheapest of the three fully automatic rifles in the game. Its magazine holds 24 bullets. It has a good fire rate, and a alternate fire of 3 round bursts. It is a 2 tap to the head and 5 to the body or legs. The Bulldog also has ADS, like other rifles.

The Bulldog is unique for having a relatively low cost compared to the other fully automatic rifles at 2050. This makes it a useful force buy for eco rounds if your team lacks money. However, it costs significantly more than SMGs.

It also has a 3 round burst, unlike other rifles, which can be good for close quarters. However, the spread significantly increases at medium to long ranges, so you'll want to use its primary fire otherwise.

The ADS is good for supporting an assault on a site or holding a site down, as it increases aim and reduces recoil and spread (Overall makes the weapon more accurate).</p>

The Guardian is unique for being the only semi automatic rifle, having a 1.5x zoom as well as the highest damage per bullet compared to any other rifles. It is also the lowest first shot spread weapon in the game.

The Guardian, though being semi-automatic, can still fire decently fast at 5.25 rounds per second. The Guardian shines at one aspect, its damage per bullet. It is a 4 to the legs, 3 to the body and 1 to the head at any range.

The Rifle shines on the defensive side, as with its extreme damage per bullet and 1.5x zoom makes it a dangerous rifle to peek, especially since it's a guaranteed one tap to the head.</p>

The Phantom comes equipped with a high fire rate and a silencer which makes it extremely useful for ambushing, since at closer ranges, a single shot to the head will result in instant death. At longer ranges, it is a 6 tap to the legs, 5 to the body and 2 to the head.

The Phantom is typically seen in gun rounds due to its larger price tag than SMGs or other rifles. The ADS is great for holding down sites and further decreasing its recoil and spread to make it a extremely accurate fully automatic rifle.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Vandal is a fully automatic rifle that sits at 2,900 Credits. It is the counterpart to the Phantom, and is unique for its high DPS at any range. It is incredibly lethal due to its ability to kill opponents with one shot to the head at all ranges. Like other rifles, one can aim down the sights (ADS) to reduce spread at the cost of fire rate.

The fully-automatic Vandal sacrifices higher spread and recoil for a linear damage range; regardless of distance, it will always kill in five shots to the legs, four to the body and one shot to the head.

Due to its hefty price, the Vandal is mostly seen in gun rounds (rounds where both teams have money). The Vandal's ADS can be used to hold down a site by reducing the recoil and spread of the weapon, and can be combined with the extreme damage the Vandal can output at range.</p>

At 8 or fewer meters, 8 pellets to the body are enough to kill, while 12 pellets are needed at 8-12 m. Any pellets that strike the head deal double damage.

Past 12 meters, the primary fire is near useless, but the alternate fire allows Bucky users to extend its range by firing a single shell containing pellets that explode at 7.5 meters, allowing its user to fight enemies at a medium distance.[1] If the pellet strikes a target before 7.5 meters however, it will only deal 1 pellet worth of damage.

Like other pump action shotguns, the Bucky can be reloaded after a single shot at no cost to the fire rate, effectively increasing its magazine size from 5 to 15.</p>

At 10 or fewer meters, 9 pellets are needed to oneshot an armored agent. Pellets that hit the head deal double damage and pellets that hit the legs deal 5/6 damage.

While it does less damage per bullet than the Bucky, it makes up for it with its significantly reduced spread and higher fire rate making the gun much more forgiving. Crouching reduces the spread much more with the Judge than it does with the Bucky.</p>

It costs the same as the Spectre, but while the Spectre specializes at short to medium range fights, the Ares is better at a distance due to its low damage falloff.

It has an extremely high rate of fire, coupled with a large magazine, Feel free to spray through smokes and walls. Simple spray pattern ⁠— just pull down ⁠— Effective at both short and long range. A nice deal over the Bulldog and Spectre choice for half-buys, anti-ecos, and even eco rounds rounds.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Odin is the second most expensive gun in the game, costing 3200 credits. It is a heavy weapon that, like the Ares, is best used for wallbanging due to its high wall penetration and high magazine size, which is the highest in the game at 100. Its primary fire, again like the Ares, speeds up during fire but unlike the Ares, its ADS allows you to immediately start shooting at its maximum fire rate.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Marshal is a Primary weapon that serves as the cheaper counterpart to the Operator. It has a fast movement speed and high damage per bullet, as well as a cost of 950 credits.

The Marshal is unique compared to the Operator for having a extremely fast scoping animation, great no-scope accuracy and a fast movement speed. This can be used to peek quickly and get a shot off very easily. It is a two shot to the body, one to the head and two to the legs against heavy armor.

Another advantage with the Marshal is the cost. At 1000 credits, it's cheaper than many other weapons, making it useful for force buys.</p>

      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Operator has the highest damage per bullet out of all the weapons in the game, making it a force to be reckoned with due to its one-hit-kill nature. It is also the most expensive weapon in the game at 4700 credits.

The scope has a dual zoom mode: the 5x can focus on holding tight angles, while 2.5x handles better in more open areas.

The weapon has a notably low fire-rate, creating a large window of vulnerability that allow enemies to easily retaliate. It is also the longest equip time weapon in the game at 1.5 seconds. Auto scope-in after firing a shot can be enabled from the settings menu.</p>
